Tarot Card Self Reflection Web App with React #39

## Description

The tarot is a pack of playing cards (most commonly numbering 78), used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play a group of card games. From the late 18th century until the present time the tarot has also found use by mystics and occultists for divination. Each card has a picture and title that represents a specific concept or archetype. The belief in divination associated with Tarot focuses on the prospect that whatever cards are dealt to the participant will be revelatory. 
It can also be a tool for self reflection, which will be the primary purpose of the app.

Write a simple tarot card reader using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

## Context

Sometimes using metaphor and archetype is a good way to dive into your own psyche.
[User experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) is a [critical part](https://designshack.net/articles/why-does-user-experience-matter/) of any successful app and this project will use front end

**Reflection Questions**
Do you need a database or Oauth log in?
What does quality code look like? 

**Learning:** 
- Reinforce back end and front end development skills.
- build skills in React
- deploy app using heroku
- [Learn about](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf) user experience.
